 * 
 * The main RepairShop class is not included in this RepairShopService class for the following 
 * reasons:
 * 1. To avoid feature envy design pattern where one class is doing too much.
 * 2. It is not needed as the atomic classes already implement it's services.
 * 3. System is composed of only one main RepairShop manager class not multiple.
