# ECSE 321 - Introduction to Software Engineering<br/> Project Group 09
## Project Overview

<p align='justify'> As a team of five software developers, we are developing both an online and an Android app for an auto repair shop which will allow their clientele to book their own appointments as well as receive periodical reminders for checkups and regular maintenance. The shop‚Äôs administrators will be able to insert the technicians‚Äô schedule in the software. Customers will be able to view the technicians‚Äô availability and book their own appointments for a car wash, a tire change, or a car inspection. During the development of this software, we will follow the working structure of the 4 main software engineering activities: specification, development, validation, and evolution.</p>
